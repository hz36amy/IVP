              <p><b>Air pollution</b> is the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials. 
            There are different types of pollutants, such as gases, particulates and biological molecules.
            Different provinces in China have different items of pollutants included in calculating the 
            air pollution index according to local situation and regulation. 
            The following pollutants are mainly observed in Beijing: <b>PM2.5, PM10, 
            SO2, NO2, CO and O3</b>.
            Among them, PM2.5 and PM10 represent for fine particulate matter and inhalable particles.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">With the development of urbanization, air pollution has gradually endangered human health. 
            The nation has also adopted controlling policies recent years. But are you really familiar with 
            air pollution? I select the air-quality data from <b>12 nationally-controlled monitoring sites</b>
            between 2013-03-01 to 2017-02-28. Hope you can learn more with this visualization.</p>
              <p style="display:inline; font-size:large;"><b>Which season has the best air quality?
                Which area is the most polluted?</b></p>

              <div id="map"></div><div style="height: 480px;"></div>
            <p>As you can see, the air quality of Beijing is significantly
                better in summer than other seasons. This is because the temperature
                and monsoon in summer is beneficial for the spread of pollutants.
                However, one pollutants is distinct contray to the general trend.
                If you click the bar chart or label of <b>O3</b>, you will see a 
                zenith in summer. Continued high temperature and strong sunshine in 
                Summer is conducive to atmospheric photochemical reaction of nitrogen oxides
                and volatile organic compounds, thus generating strong oxidants such 
                as near-ground ozone. Gaseous pollutants in the atmosphere may also 
                generate secondary aerosols in this highly oxidized environment, which 
                further aggravates PM2.5 pollution, showing the characteristics of combined 
                surface <b>O3</b> and <b>PM2.5</b> pollution.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you observe the map, you will find that there is also an obvious
                differences in pollution levels among these sites. Why was that happen?
                This is mainly because of the special surface of Beijing city, its surrounding
                mountains makes the wind field easy to converge in the piedmont region, that is 
                the south part of Beijing. Additionally, the north and west part of the city locates
                at the upwind, where the pollutants are difficult to aggregate.

              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">According to newspaper, Beijing began to restrict the use of vehicles
                  and other related policies to control the worsening of air pollution.

              <p>
                  Based on the line chart, it is clearly to see a declining trend
                  of <b>SO2</b> concentration. The particle
                  pollutants <b>PM2.5</b>,<b>PM10</b> and <b>NO2</b> shows a slight increase
                  in 2014 but decreased a lit bit after that. While except for that,
                  <b>CO</b> and <b>O3</b> shows no obvious increase or decrease trend.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Although some of the pollutants decreased between this period,
                  we still need to pay more efforts together to improve the air
                  quality of the city. Because the <b style="color: rgb(224, 0, 0);">national annual standard of PM2.5</b>
                  (dashed line) is far below the current level.

                  It is clearly to observe a downward trend of <b style="color: rgb(224, 0, 0);">
                    total industrial output value</b>, which actually corresponds to the 
                    trend for SO2. Why was that? Most of the SO2 in the air comes from the 
                    industrial production. As for <b style="color: rgb(0, 97, 224);">GDP</b>
                    and <b style="color: rgb(0, 165, 69);">Population</b>, although they
                    don't show rapid increase or decrease trend, they clearly match the 
                    trend of air pollutants very well. In conclusion, human factor may 
                    influence air quality to a large extent. So protecting the atmospheric 
                    environment is the duty of every citizen.
